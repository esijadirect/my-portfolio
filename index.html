          <p>
            I’m a Full Stack Developer with 3 years of experience in building dynamic web applications 
            and scalable microservices. I’ve worked extensively with cloud-based deployments, particularly
             on platforms like IBM Cloud and Microsoft Azure. My recent projects have focused on developing
              containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes, and integrating CI/CD pipelines with GitLab.
